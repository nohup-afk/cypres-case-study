1. Investigation Steps

    Understand the Problem Some users can’t log in sometimes. Doesn’t happen to everyone or every time.

2. Check the Logs

    Look at server logs for failed login attempts.

    Check for:

        Error messages (e.g., "401 Unauthorized", "Token expired")

        Affected usernames

        Time of failure

        IP addresses or devices

3. Try to Reproduce It

    Use the same browser/device as the user.

    Try logging in:

        After clearing cookies

        In incognito mode

        On slow network

        Multiple times in a row

4. Test Possible Causes

    Try fixing common issues:

        Update cookie settings (SameSite, Secure)

        Check session timeout settings

        Add a small delay before redirecting after login
